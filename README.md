## DashBoard 1: SUMMARY
### This dashboard focuses on high-level KPIs to assess the overall health of the loan portfolio:
* Total Loan Applications: Count applications during a specified period, with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) metrics.
* Total Funded Amount: Total funds were disbursed, and MTD and MoM were monitored.
* Total Amount Received: Tracks loan repayment amounts over time.
* Average Interest Rate: Average interest across loans, with MTD and MoM changes.
* Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: Gauges borrower financial health by monitoring DTI changes over time.
### Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs:
* Good Loans: Based on 'Fully Paid' and 'Current' status, tracking applications, funded amount, and total received.
* Bad Loans: Loans with a 'Charged Off' status, tracking applications, funded amount, and total received.

## DashBoard 2: OVERVIEW
### This dashboard uses visual tools to provide an in-depth analysis of loan metrics and trends:
* Monthly Trends (Line Chart): Shows total applications, funded amount, and amount received over time.
* Regional Analysis (Filled Map): Displays lending activity across different states.
* Loan Term Breakdown (Donut Chart): Depicts loan statistics by term lengths (e.g., 36 vs 60 months).
* Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Illustrates lending distribution by borrowers’ employment length.
* Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Visualizes loans based on the borrower’s stated purpose (e.g., debt consolidation).
* Home Ownership Analysis (TreeMap): Hierarchical view of loans based on home ownership status.
